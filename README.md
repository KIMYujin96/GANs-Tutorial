# GANs-Tutorial
This repository contains a tutorial about GAN's. Since their invention by Ian Goodfellow GAN's have become a really hot topic in the field of AI more specifically in Deep Learning. As a researcher of computer vision I love playing with GAN's. I use GAN's mainly for my research.

I have created this tutorial to learn and teach GAN's to the audience. My goal is to build various GAN architectures using TensorFlow 2 and use them for custom dataset. I have mainly used Vanilla GAN, DCGAN, CDCGAN, and pix2pix models in my tutorial. I have organized my tutorials as Labs.

# Tutorial
This tutorial is prepared for <a href="http://www.cse.or.kr/">Korean Society Of Computational Science And Engineering</a>. The schedule for this years KSCSE can found <a href="http://www.cse.or.kr/board/conference/62">here</a>.
